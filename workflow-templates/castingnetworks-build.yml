# This workflow is 1 of 4 workflows that should be added as a package when used in a repository.
# The 4 workflows and the order they should be applied in are:
# 
# * = You are here
# 
# 1. *castingnetworks-build.yml
# 2. castingnetworks-force-prerelease.yml
# 3. castingnetworks-delete-release.yml
# 4. castingnetworks-release.yml
# 
# 
# The workflows are designed to be used in nodejs projects that use nx for the build and have an optional terraform directory.
# This workflow file covers the standard build and test and is the same template that is used for the release.
# 
# Workflow:
# 1. Lint & Test
# 2. Get Build Jobs
# 3. Sonar Cloud Scan
# 4. Integration Tests
# 5. Calculate Release/Artifact Tag (value is used for s3 and ecr artifacts)
# 6. Build Libs - Matrix job that builds all the libraries in the project
# 7. Build Lambdas - Matrix job that builds all the lambdas in the project and uploads them to s3
# 8. Deploy to Development - Builds and Pushes a Docker Image to ECR. Uses the 'development' environment in GitHub
# 9. [NOT PART OF EXECUTION FROM THIS WORKFLOW] Deploy to Staging - Builds and Pushes a Docker Image to ECR.
#      Uses the 'staging' environment in GitHub. 
#      The staging job works by injecting a suffix into the artifact tag to differentiate it from the production environment.
# 10. [NOT PART OF EXECUTION FROM THIS WORKFLOW] Deploy to Production - Copies S3 artifacts and retags the ECR image removing
#      the suffix in both instances.
# 
# To use this workflow in a repository, the following steps should be followed:
# 1. Update the branch pattern to limit the branches that should be built if possible
# 2. Ensure the required secrets are set in the repository:
#   - NPM_AUTH_TOKEN
#   - NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN (Required if the project contains libraries that are published as a package)
#   - SONAR_TOKEN (Optional)
# 3. Replace the REPLACE_ placeholders in the file with the appropriate values for the service
#   - REPLACE_SERVICENAME: This should be replaced with the name of the service (e.g. Core API)
#   - REPLACE_KEY: This should be replaced with the name of the bucket key for the service (e.g. b21/core-api)
# 4. Review the env: section and update the variables as needed
# 
# Please note AWS Authentication is handled by OIDC and there should be no need to add AWS credentials to the repository secrets.
# 
# Please reach out to the Devops team if you have any questions or need assistance with this workflow.
