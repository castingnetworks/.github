# This workflow is 1 of 4 workflows that should be added as a package when used in a repository.
# The 4 workflows and the order they should be applied in are:
# 
# * = You are here
# 
# 1. castingnetworks-build.yml
# 2. *castingnetworks-force-prerelease.yml
# 3. castingnetworks-delete-release.yml
# 4. castingnetworks-release.yml
# 
# 
# This workflow is part of the standard Release Process and is used to ensure all newly created releases are marked as a prerelease.
# 
# This workflow enables us to trust the state of releases in GitHub and know that any release labeled as 'latest' is what is currently deployed to production.
# The most recent release labeled 'prerelease' is what is currently deployed to staging.
# The expectation is that a prerelease will be deployed to staging and needs to be promoted to production.
# 
# There is no configuration needed for this workflow and it should be added to the repository as is.
# 
# Please reach out to the Devops team if you have any questions or need assistance with this workflow.
